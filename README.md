#YOLOv5 Number Plate Detector

This is a Python script that uses the YOLOv5 object detection model to detect number plates in a video. It takes a video file as input and outputs a video file with the detected number plates highlighted in green boxes. Additionally, it saves the coordinates and confidence intervals of the detected number plates to a text file.

The script uses the PyTorch deep learning framework and the OpenCV computer vision library to perform the detection. It loads the YOLOv5 model and preprocesses each frame of the input video by resizing and normalizing it. It then runs the model on the preprocessed frame to generate a set of detections. Finally, it postprocesses the detections by filtering out non-number-plate objects and drawing bounding boxes around the detected number plates.

The script includes a function detect_number_plates() that takes three arguments: the path of the input video file, the path of the output video file, and the input image size (default is 640). The function returns a list of tuples containing the coordinates and confidence intervals of the detected number plates.

To use this script, simply clone the repository and run the detect_number_plates() function with your desired input and output video paths. You will need to have PyTorch and OpenCV installed on your system.

The purpose of this script is to provide a way to automate the detection of number plates in a video using YOLOv5. By using this script, users can quickly and accurately identify number plates in large amounts of video data.
